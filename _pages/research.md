* **[A House for Two: Empowering Women with Property Rights](https://akankshavardani.github.io/files/Housefortwo_dropbox.pdf)**  
	<details>
		  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Formal property ownership may not empower women unless it is understood by those they interact with. I study the effect of improving awareness about property rights on women’s empowerment through a field experiment in rural Maharashtra. I work in a setting where after a recent policy change married women are documented owners but only 26% believe they are. I randomize an awareness campaign across 1,783 households that informs both spouses that women co-own their property and delivers a physical copy of the ownership document. The campaign improves knowledge that women hold property rights, increases expenditure on women-specific goods by 40%, and reduces men’s alcohol consumption by 33%, though it has no overall effect on domestic violence. I develop and test an intra-household bargaining model, which highlights that the effect of the campaign may differ when the woman already knows but the spouse does not, and where neither know. Consistent with the model’s predictions, the strongest consumption effects are observed in households with the lowest initial beliefs about women’s ownership, while reductions in domestic violence occur in households where the husband’s initial beliefs are lower than the wife’s. This study highlights how shifting beliefs about women’s rights is essential to realizing the full impact of large-scale government programs.

How does being connected to a local elected leader affect property tax compliance? Using a close election difference-in-discontinuities design, we quantify the effect of being connected to a local elected leader on tax liability and compliance. We use novel administrative data on property taxation from an Indian district and find that citizens connected to local elected leaders are 45 percentage points more likely to remit taxes and remit 351% more in taxes. We also find that these results are partially driven by enforcement as those who are connected are 30.8 percentage points more likely to face fines and face 247% more in fines. Among those who are connected to the local elected leader, we find that these results are driven by poorer property owners.
